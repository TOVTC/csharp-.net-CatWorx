// to store first name, last name, id number, and photo, we need to accommodate for the different data types of each property
// dictionaries can only hold one data type, and we could theoretically transform all our values to strings for storage using "casting"
// but it's difficult to anticipate all the cases for dealing with these properties, so we choose to create a class
// C# permits defining multiple classes in the same file, but we modularize our code to keep it organized

// wrapping our class in the namespace scope declaration allows us to access it directly from any class that uses CatWorx.BadgeMaker
namespace CatWorx.BadgeMaker
{
    class Employee{
        // more to come
    }
}
